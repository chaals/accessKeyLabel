      <p> This is a proposal to extend HTML with an <code>accessKeyLabel</code> DOM attribute. In contrast to the HTML5 version, this
        proposal includes a microsyntax based on DOM UI Events that ensures the value returned is parseable</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd">
      <p>This is an unofficial draft. There is one implementation of accessKeyLabel, in Firefox, which followed HTML5 in allowing different
        syntax for different platforms. It was therefore <a target="_blank" title="https://github.com/w3c/html/pull/144" href="https://github.com/w3c/html/pull/144">removed

      <h2>Why <code>accessKeyLabel</code>?</h2>
      <p> User Agents actually assign accesskeys and other shortcuts - or block them. So user agents should inform the user of assigned
        activation triggers or focusing shortcuts. However, they generally do this badly, and authors are used to doing so - in part because
        successive specifications for <code>accesskey</code> have asked them to do so in an apparently thoughtless violation of the
        "priority of constituencies" design principle.</p>
      <p>The <code>accessKeyLabel</code> DOM attribute allows authors to do so in ways that are natural to the flow of their application.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>To tell the user what the shortcut key is, the author has this script here opted to explicitly add the key combination to the
          button's label:</p>
        <pre highlight="javascript">function addShortcutKeyLabel(button) {
  if (button.accessKeyLabel != '')
    button.value += ' (' + button.accessKeyLabel + ')';
}
 
addShortcutKeyLabel(document.getElementById('c'));
     </pre>
      </div>

      <p><code>accessKeyLabel</code> can be used as information for fingerprinting a user, in particular if the user sets up their browser
        to specify shortcut activations that are adapted to their personal needs or preferences.</p>

      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
      <p> Many thanks to Robin Berjon for making our lives so much easier with his cool tool, Ian Hickson for showing that implementation is
        critically important, Mozilla for doing an implemenation of the HTML5 version of <code>accessKeyLabel</code>,&nbsp; many people for
        contributing to the discussion on how discoverability is critical.</p>
